Yasir Karim and Amir Edris

Sources: Imdb, Box Offic Mojo, The Numbers & Kaggle.
## Introduction
Microsoft has set their intentions on venturing into the movie industry. They have decided to create their own movie studio. We are tasked with analyzing the state of the industry in order to guide Microsoft to take their first steps. We have relied heavily on our pre-existing knowledge of the industry and the box office in deciding which questions we would like explore. 
## Data Cleaning And Exploration
From the get go we wanted to explore data regarding a movies studio, genre, prodcution budget, revenue and date. We believe that these are vital information in analyzing the state of the box office. Out of the csv files that were provided to us we used the files from Box Office Mojo and The Numbers, as they had the information that we needed. However, we need more data to work with including but not limited to data regarding sales of Microsofts video games. From Kaggle, we found a csv file with video game sales information along with their genre, console, studio etc. For further information on box office information we used webscraping to get tables from IMDb and The numbers website.

### Queries
We wanted to answer the following questions through our exploration and analysis of the collected data.

```
1. Is the decision to produce and distribute films the right decision at this time?`
2. Has the global industry changed in any shape or form in this century?`
3. Is it benficial or harmful to use intellectual property owned by Microsoft as source material?
    a. What are Microsofts highest selling genre and title of video games?
4. What level of budget in a movie is more profitable and yields the highest return on investment?
5. Analyze the business of a popular movie studio based on our findings.
6. Is their a certain time of the year when it's more preferrable to release films?
```

### Visualizations
After completeing exploratory data analysis to answer our questions, we made graphs to help visualize our findings for the non-technical audience. We have related one or more plots to each question.

`- For Q1. see: link to figure or plot here for each question `

## Conclusion
### Reccomendations

* Creating a new movie studio at this time is the right decision.
    * Global market has significantly changed in the past decade. Overseas revenue has increased by over 150%, which has garnered far greater profits for studios.
* Microsoft should rightfully use its existing gaming franchises to adapt them into feature films.
    * Movis based on comic books or video games yield far greater return than movies based on original screenplay.
    * Sequels dominate the top of box office charts yearly. Therefore, once we have succesfully launched our properties into movies, it is important to follow then up sequels. This is mirroring the same way microsoft makes sequels to their popular video games.
    * Use the highest selling games such as Halo and others that match genres that with films with the greatest profits.
* Invest in either big budget action or smaller horror films for optimal success.
    * hugher budgets yield the greatest gross profit but smaller budgets have greater return on investment. Therefore, avoid making mid budget films.
* Release movies during the summer or holiday seasons.
    * Movies released in May, June, July, November and December result in far higher revenues than movies released during the rest of the year.
  
### Future Work
We can dive even deeper in terms of research to construct our perfect and profitable movie studio. We can look to answer the following questions:

* Strip our research on original films even further by removing seqeuls, remakes or reboots by considering them popular I.P.
* Analyze the many genres to reveal which of them have the highest return on investment.
* How much does the runtime of a movie affect its box office?
* Should microsoft create its own T.V division?
* Should we release our films on streaming services, if so, which genres are better suited for that platform?
* Is it profitable to buy rights for novel/play adaptations?
